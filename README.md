# Battleship Game

Welcome to the Battleship game project! This is a classic single-player strategy game where you'll be arranging your ships and attempting to sink the computer's fleet. We invite you to contribute to this open-source Python project to enhance the gameplay and bring new features to the table.

## Rules of the Game

Before you start contributing, it's important to understand the rules of Battleship:

- The game is played on two square grids, one for the player and one for the computer, typically 8x8 in size.
- The player secretly arranges their ships on their grid. There are three ship types:
  - Battleship (3 squares)
  - Submarine (2 squares)
  - Patrol Boat (1 square)
- The computer also arranges its ships secretly.
- Ships must be placed without overlapping and occupy consecutive squares either horizontally or vertically.
- The game begins with the player taking turns guessing the coordinates to target the computer's ships.
- A successful hit results in the announcement of the sinking of that ship.
