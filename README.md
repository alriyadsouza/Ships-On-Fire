# Ships-On-Fire
A Game using python

The game of Battleship is played on two square grids, one for each player. The grids are typically 8x8, and each square is identified by a letter and number coordinate.

Before the game begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their grid. The ships come in three different types: Battleship (3 squares), Submarine (2 squares), and Patrol Boat (1 square). The number of ships of each type is the same for both players.

The ships must be placed so that they do not overlap, and each ship occupies a consecutive set of squares either horizontally or vertically. Once all ships are placed, the game begins with each player taking turns trying to guess the location of their opponent's ships by calling out coordinates on the grid. 

Once the ships have been positioned, the game moves into a series of rounds. Each round consists of both players taking turns to call out a target square on their opponent's grid to shoot at. If a player successfully hits a ship, they announce the sinking of that particular ship - whether it's a Battleship, Submarine, or Patrol Boat.

If a player loses all of their ships, the game ends and their opponent is declared the winner. The game can also be won by scoring six points before the opponent, with each successful hit counting as one point.

Overall, the game of Battleship requires strategy, planning, and a bit of luck, making it a fun and engaging game for players of all ages.
