# Ships-On-Fire
A Game using python

The game of Battleship is played on two square grids, one for each player. The grids are typically 8x8, and each square is identified by a letter and number coordinate.

Before the game begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their grid. The ships come in three different types: Battleship (3 squares), Submarine (2 squares), and Patrol Boat (1 square). The number of ships of each type is the same for both players.

The ships must be placed so that they do not overlap, and each ship occupies a consecutive set of squares either horizontally or vertically. Once all ships are placed, the game begins with each player taking turns trying to guess the location of their opponent's ships by calling out coordinates on the grid. A hit is scored if the guess lands on a square occupied by a ship, and the player who sinks all of their opponent's ships first wins the game.
